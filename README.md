# SimpleStore
Simple Store is a simple website for saving file online quickly without a lot of authentication but secured.
Every file has a lifespan of 1 hour and will be deleted when a new request come.
Its general uses is when you move your file from one device to other device quickly.
It's hugely inspired by [protectedtext.com](https://www.protectedtext.com).
I used firebase as the database which is free to use and I used expressjs as API to connect the database.

# Database Uses
- Storing storage data
- Storing Files Data (include the lifespan)

# Future Update
- Removing session for more security (just like the protectedtext)
- New UI Design
